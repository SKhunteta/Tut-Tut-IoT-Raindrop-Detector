  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to read the temperature of the ICs
  
  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15050

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Spectral Triad and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 9600 baud to see the output
