[*SparkFun Triad Spectroscopy Sensor (SEN-15050)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15050)

This is an Arduino library to control the AS7265X Spectral Sensors, which can be configured via I<sup>2</sup>C. You can download this library via the Arduino library manager by searching '*SparkFun Triad*'. 

The SparkFun Triad Spectroscopy Sensor is a powerful optical inspection sensor. Three AS7265x sensors are combined alongside a visible, UV, and IR LEDs to illuminate and test various surfaces for light spectroscopy. The Triad detects 18 discrete channels of light from 372nm (UV) to 966nm (IR) enabling desktop spectroscopy.

What can you do with light spectroscopy? Itâ€™s an amazing field of study, and the SparkFun Triad brings what used to be prohibitively expensive equipment to the desktop. The AS7265x should not be confused with highly complex mass spectrometers, but the sensor array does give the user the ability to measure and characterize how different materials absorb and reflect 18 different frequencies of light.
